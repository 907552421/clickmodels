clickmodels
===========

ClickModels is a small set of Python scripts for the user click models. A *Click Model* is a probabilistic graphical model used to predict search engine click data from past observations. This project is aimed to deal with click models used in Information Retrieval (see next section) and intended to be easy-to-read and easy-to-modify. If it's not, please let me know how to improve it :)
